Mental Health Treatment Hackathon Project
A web application designed to help address mental health issues by providing an AI-powered companion and a recommendation system to support users in need.

Project Overview
Our project utilizes a chatbot and machine learning to deliver mental health support. This web application features an AI companion, powered by the Gemini API, fine-tuned to act as a virtual therapist or guide for users. Additionally, a recommendation system based on machine learning offers users suggestions from people who faced similar challenges and overcame them.

Key Features
AI Companion: An interactive chatbot, created using the Gemini API, trained to provide therapeutic responses and guidance to users.
Recommendation System: A machine learning model built with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend helpful resources and peer experiences based on usersâ€™ mental health challenges.
User Reviews: Allows users to share their experiences and read reviews from others who have used the platform.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for an accessible, responsive experience that supports users across various devices.
Future Improvements
We envision adding more features to enhance user support and engagement:

Personalized Blog Recommendations: Suggested blog readings based on similar users' journeys.
Sentiment Analysis: Enhanced feedback through sentiment analysis, helping to tailor responses to user moods.
